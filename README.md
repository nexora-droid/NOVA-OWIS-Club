## Features
```<!---TO BE ADDED--->```

## Note to HackClub Fraud Team

I just realised that we need to put regular commits after around 30mins-1hr of coding time. And I have not done as such, so here are the list of details that I have done for each day of code I did! (sry i didn't take photos)

### Logs of Updates/Days Spent Coding
_**Day 1**_
- Spend around 45 minutes building a feature where when you hover on the name of the club it shows the full form and when you don't hover it shows the short form.
- Spent around 15 minutes building the basic layout with headings for the content to be added in the coming days.


_**Day 2**_
- Spent around 1hr building the menu bar and navigation links and also fixing the auto-scroll cutting of the titles when you click on the buttons in the navigation in the top of the screen.
- I tried using the infamous 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet' text to check if it worked and it did!


_**Day 3**_
- Spent 1hr building cards for the leaders I have in my club (yet worked on the webpage solo üëç) with hover animation where the a small blue border appears and a shadow appears with transitions
   - Also uses JS to make a animation where all the cards on the page rise up after 0.2s of its previous one on _reload_ of page.

_**Day 4**_
- Spent 30 minutes reusing the styling for my leader cards for my about us cards which included: 'Who are we?', 'Our Vision' and 'Our Mission'.
- Pretty easy as I just resued the styles

_**Day 5**_
- Major Update.
    - Fixed a few bugs within the card styling
    - Built 2 cards for 'Our Partners' Section one with Hack Club and one for my school
    - ```<!--As of Wednesday 15 October 2025 3:07pm UTC, cool animations for such are being developed-->
